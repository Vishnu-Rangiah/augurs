Dear future me,

Something very weird is happening when trying to run the prophet model in the WASM environment.

Everything _looks_ fine, but by the second iteration of the optimizer the gradient and log prob look
completely different to when it's run outside of WASM.

To do:

- print out the data before the first iteration of the optimization, from _inside STAN_.
